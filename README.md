# Type8 - A Chip8 Emulator written in Typescript
WIP.

For fun :-)

### How to run:
- `npm install webpack-dev-server -g`
- `webpack-dev-server --progress --colors`
Changes should reflect automatically

### How to run tests:
- npm install
- npm test

### TODO:
[] Clean up comments
[] Make logging configurable. I want to be able to debug issues but not have to scroll three days between opcodes
